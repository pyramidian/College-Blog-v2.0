Social Media is Not the Evil it is Made Out to Be

Social media is seen by many as the killer of the peer to peer relationships of yesteryear. Instead of having a conversation at the dinner table, people bury their faces in their phones. Instead of caring about how they are actually perceived by others, people only care about the amount of “likes” on the selfie they uploaded to Facebook. Although these are trends that are appearing more frequently as social media gains a greater grasp on society, it’s not necessarily a bad thing. The ability to function well online and manage different online personas is actually a life skill which is growing rapidly in importance, following suit with the world’s advancement in the computing and the spread of global internet connectivity. Using Bronwyn T. Williams’ article, “‘Tomorrow Will Not Be Like Today’: Literacy and Identity in a World of Multiliteracies” and Elisabeth H. Buck’s webtext, “Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Oh My!” it can be proven that social media is actually a catalyst for promoting student interest in writing and rhetoric. 
	
Bronwyn T. Williams, an English professor at the University of Louisville, seems to believe that the social networking etiquette of Facebook, Twitter, and the likes are very good mediums for kids and teenagers to experience what it feels like writing for a global audience without any prior professional writing experience. Social media allows people to control who sees what they post and it is evident that varying audiences calls for various ways of writing. The ability which stems from this, being able to multiple identities, is a very good skill to have as a writer as it allows for one to change viewpoint almost instantly and adapt to situations as they come. Unknowingly to these people, they are gaining experience in rhetorical writing and slowly adapting an affinity to the subject.
	
Williams also applauds the reading/writing implications of social media. It has been found by researchers that many new users of a social network learn the etiquette of that particular network by reading previous posts and use of trial and error. Within the plethora of online discussion boards and blogs, there are a multitude of different ideas floating around. As stated by Williams, “Upon entering these groups, they not only need to figure out the context-specific customs of messages and responses for each group.” Another skill which browsers of such content have to master is the determination of which user and/or post is reputable and can be trusted and which ones are satirical. Both contextual adaptability and source reputability identification are key skills needed for academic reading and writing which people are learning to master using social media. This, again, increases proficiency in rhetorical writing.

Elisabeth H. Buck, a Ph.D. student at Ball State University, seems to place value on and promote a similar, yet slightly different aspect of social media. She believes that online interactions through social media can be a useful tool in the classroom setting and discussion. She references Jane Mathison Fife and Stephanie Vie’s classroom study regarding the topic to help prove that many social media sites can be used to teach rhetorical analysis within the classroom (Buck, 2015). Classroom activities were carried out in order to help students grasp the rhetorical techniques which they use every day when posting on social media sites. One technique which stood above the rest in terms of performance is that of audience awareness, or the ability to adapt ones writing style based on who the text was intended for. This aspect was one of which Williams also identified as being a positive effect of social media use. 
Although both Buck and Williams do agree on the same general idea of audience adaptation, the way this idea is introduced in each piece of writing varies between each author. Williams introduces the subject as a side effect of general social media use, stemming from the idea that social media itself inherently calls for the management of multiple identities. Buck, on the other hand, introduces the topic with a reference to William’s own paper. However, she does acknowledge the fact that overuse of the rhetorical method of appealing to one’s audience does have its negatives as it overshadows the writer’s own thoughts and opinions with those of others.

Another subject Buck touches on is the specific exigency of each post a person makes on a social media site. Most of the time, the poster will publish something in order to gain likes and views but as the reason for posting changes, so does the style of writing within the post. This tendency ties in nicely with the audience awareness aspect of Williams’ article as well as the overarching topic of rhetorical writing. It all really boils down to the definition of rhetorical writing itself. Rhetorical writing is defined as “the art of speaking or writing effectively” or “the study of writing or speaking as a means of communication or persuasion” with the keyword being persuasion. In essence almost all social media users try to promote their own ideas or share something with a targeted group of people. Why are teachers struggling so hard to teach rhetoric is classrooms when every student already knows how and has been doing so on social media every day?

It is a common practice for students today to lose interest in academic writing and recede back to social media as a means of ranting about academic struggles. Little do these students know that by doing this, they are practicing rhetorical writing completely voluntarily. Both Williams and Buck seem to support the idea of harnessing this tendency to raise enthusiasm in the classroom when trying to teach writing and rhetoric. By integrating social networking posts into daily classroom activities, it is pretty easy to grasp the attention of a group of students and engage them with an activity as simple as writing a twitter post about the day’s lesson. Instead of pushing aside social media as a means of distraction and something that draws the student away from education, it should be taken advantage of and used to incorporate learning and the student’s daily lifestyle as one.
