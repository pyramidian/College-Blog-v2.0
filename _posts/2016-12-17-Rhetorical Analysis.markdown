How Does a Gaming Company Attract Players to an Ambitious New Title?

Blizzard Entertainment, a name notorious for innovation, pioneered the MMORPG genre with World of Warcraft back in 2004, reinvented online card battling with Hearthstone in 2014, and established a solid foothold in the world of MOBA titles with Heroes of the Storm in 2015. Now in 2016, Blizzard shifts its focus to a game genre never explored by the company before, first-person shooter. Released in May, Overwatch is Blizzard’s largest attempt at an FPS title, and its release went on without a hitch. Part of what made Overwatch’s release so successful was the massive amount of advertising and showcasing the company pushed out as early as a full year before release. Specifically, the use of pathos on the Overwatch Facebook page along with its numerous uses in its animated short films is what lead to the spike in interest towards the game and eventually resulted in Overwatch being the 10th best-selling PC game of all time.
The advertising effort begins with the Overwatch Facebook page, a public page owned by Blizzard which updates regularly with new Overwatch news and noteworthy fan creations. From the day the game’s release date was announced, the page has been steadily growing in followers eager to receive information about the year’s most hyped title. This was an excellent move on Blizzard’s part as taking advantage of social media is a must if one wants to capture the attention of today’s generation. Almost every millennial, young adult, or even grade schooler has access to social media websites like Facebook, and they all probably check their “liked” pages daily as well. For Blizzard to announce all news on their Facebook page means that they are getting the information out to as many people as possible, in the most efficient way possible, therefore resulting in even greater spread of game popularity.

It wasn’t only the fact that social media was used as the primary medium for developer-customer interaction which made Overwatch such a huge success, but also the content which was posted on Facebook itself. Even before the game’s official release there was daily content being posted showcasing the game’s many playable heroes, current and upcoming.

The example shown was taken from the page a month before game’s scheduled release date. Its goal seems to be to induce a sense of vigor and enthusiasm in the community, focusing mainly on those who already pre-purchased the game. The simple yet invigorating message uses pathos to target the emotion of fulfillment in the reader as it gives him/her a mission, to protect the realm from all evildoers who wish to cause harm. The included video of in-game characters talking to the viewer as if that person was about to enter the battle against evil also helps to spark emotion.
Along with posts targeting emotion, there have been fan creations based on previously released gameplay footage featured on the page, as well as many Overwatch inspired memes created by the development team itself. These not only resulted in even greater spread of game popularity, some would say on a viral level, but also gave the community which was already over 5 million supporters strong at this point a sign that Blizzard will take care of their fans. Many of the people who were looking forward to the game were those who already had much prior experience in the world of online gaming. These people are ones who value the dedication a company gave to their games and the various communities which spawned from these games. By showing that communication was already present before the game even released, Blizzard established that they wouldn’t simply release a game and ditch all interaction between the developers and the players like so many other gaming companies have done so in the past. This was a very well-executed use of pathos and taking advantage of the emotion of trust players can have with the company as a whole. If the majority of the community views Blizzard as a trustworthy company which will not follow in the footsteps of other large developers, people will always keep coming back to the games they make.
	
Another key factor was the release of many animated short films prior to the game’s release as well as during the game’s early stages. These films told the backstories of various heroes in the game and gave players a glimpse into the history and personality of the characters themselves. The result of this was the creation of suspense within the community. Each video exposed just a little bit more of the overall lore of the game, without giving it all away at once. There were multiple questions left unanswered after each film, and this is what further sparked interest in the game holistically, or interest not only in the core gameplay but the story which is told as well. With many of the online gamers of today valuing games with good mechanics as well as games with depth, Blizzard’s move was key to gaining even more support.  The first short to be released, “Recall” was focused around the character Winston. This genetically engineering gorilla is one of the most notable characters in the game as, according to the backstory, he was the one who initiated the process which brought all the characters together and led up to where is the game is at currently. The quality of the films themselves were comparable to those produced by large scale animation companies such as Pixar or DreamWorks, and were even premiered in theaters around the country. When players watched these films, many were very impressed by the animations themselves, and even more so by the intricate stories which were created to go along with each and every character. Bearing similarity to the Facebook page, the short films utilized pathos in order to appeal to the viewers. By always leaving part of the story untold, viewer curiosity was leveraged and just the fact that films themselves were made further increased the emotions of faith and trust which were already bolstering within the community.
	
The Overwatch release could be called one of the most successful game launches in history. Even today, after half a year has passed since release, the player base is still growing at a steady rate. It is clear that Blizzard’s dedication to its players has paid off well as they are still updating the Facebook page with daily posts, they are still created more animated short films with each being better than the last, and they are still listening intensively to all player feedback given and then going as far as to respond to this feedback via direct developer replies. Blizzard Entertainment has not only taken advantage of pathos, but have set the precedent for how all gaming companies in the future might want to approach their fan base interactions and game releases.
